                either look forward, or ignore their presence. We pretend not to

                This is something we hear time and time again. Surprisingly the
                worst part about being homeless is the feeling of not being
                apart of society. getting ignored by everyone, because they are
                stereotyping you.

                Unhoused Humanity was founded for one reason; to fill the

                A great deal of individuals who are experiencing homelessness
                have an income, but don't have the necessary amount of capital
                to enter a home. There are others who experience life
                difficulties such as high medical bills, and electricity bills,
                which causes them to run short on their monthly budget.
              </p>
              <p>
                At Unhoused Humanity we strongly believe that individuals who
                are experiencing these situations should never be homeless, or
                experience long- term homelessness. That is why our grant
                program provides those start-up cost for people who need the
                extra help back up.
