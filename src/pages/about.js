              <p>
                Unhoused Humanity is a non-profit, 501(c)3 charitable
                organization founded by students from Florida State University
                who are on a mission to diminish the boundaries that divide
                those who are homeless from the rest of society. Since its
                founding in 2015, Unhoused Humanity has placed {housedBuffer}{' '}
                people experiencing homelessness into permanent housing in the
                Tallahassee and surrounding areas.

              <p>
                Many people experiencing homelessness have a steady source of
                income to maintain themselves once they are in a home but cannot
                save up enough money to put down for their first/last monthâ€™s
                rent or their utility payments. Unhoused Humanity aims to house
                every self sustaining eligible homeless individual in
                Tallahassee, Florida. We want to serve as a model non-profit
                organization that encourages others across the globe to utilize
                this very method in an effort to reduce homelessness.
