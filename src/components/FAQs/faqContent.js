        <h3>What Is Homelessness?</h3>
        <div className="faq-section">
          <p>
            The word “homeless” often brings a particular image to mind.
            Typically, this image is an unkempt man, apparently living on the
            streets, and assumed to be struggling with mental health and
            substance abuse issues. While that stereotype represents reality for
            a relatively small percentage of people who are homeless, the faces,
            ages, and situations of those who are homeless are widely varied.
            Homelessness includes families with children, young adults, couples,
            single men and women, and unaccompanied youth.
          </p>
          <p>There are varied definitions of homelessness:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Unsheltered:</strong> People who live in places not meant
              for human habitation – on the streets, in cars, wooded areas, or
              abandoned buildings.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Sheltered:</strong> People who are staying in homeless
              shelters or transitional housing until they find stable permanent
              housing of their own.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Doubled Up:</strong> People that experience an eviction or
              similar crisis may have natural support networks and can avoid a
              homeless shelter by staying with family or friends, even though
              they cannot afford to find their own housing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Couch Surfing:</strong> People moving from one place to
              another in quick succession.{' '}
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Generally, “homeless” means lacking a fixed, regular, and adequate
            nighttime residence and living in temporary accommodations (e.g.
            shelter) or in places not meant for human habitation. Households
            fleeing domestic violence and similar threatening conditions are
            also considered homeless. For purposes of certain programs and
            funding, families with minor children who are doubled-up with family
            or friends for economic reasons may also be considered homeless, as
            are households at imminent risk of homelessness.

            The scarcity of affordable and appropriate housing is the primary
            factor causing and perpetuating homelessness in Florida. Most people
            who become homeless in Florida have extremely low incomes and have
            difficulty maintaining stable rental housing. Multiple studies
            reflect the critical shortage of housing for households with low
            income.

            reports that there are only 32 affordable available rental units for
            every 100 renter households with extremely low income statewide. Due
            to the lack of access to affordable rental units for these

            toward housing costs.

          <p>
            Low-income households are typically unemployed or underemployed due
            to a number of factors, such as a challenging labor market; limited
            education; a gap in work history; a criminal record; unreliable
            transportation or unstable housing; poor health or a disability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the past several years, homelessness in Florida has declined
            steadily and significantly. In large part this reduction is due to
            an improved economy and job growth. This is good news for our state
            and for those who have been homeless. To see continued declines in
            homelessness, it is important to recognize the critical importance
            of adequate household income and employment in preventing and
            reducing homelessness.
          </p>
          <p>
            With due recognition of the challenges for households that include
            wage-earners, the difficulty is even more severe for special needs
            households. A single, disabled individual whose sole source of
            disability income is{' '}

              Social Security Income
            </a>{' '}
            (SSI) receives a total of $735 monthly. Because market-rate
            affordable housing does not exist for a household living solely on
            SSI, subsidized affordable housing must be created to meet this
            need. For people surviving on SSI or similar levels of income, the
            primary sources of independent affordable housing are through deeply
            subsidized units or housing vouchers. The scarcity of those types of
            assistance cannot be overemphasized.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of those who experience homelessness are unable to work due to

            . Health problems can cause a person’s homelessness as well as be
            exacerbated by the experience. The lack of access to health care
            affects homelessness in several ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, a health emergency and related uninsured health costs can
            cause a person to become homeless. Not only does a health problem
            often result in the loss of employment and income, but medical debt
            can exhaust all{' '}

              financial resources
            </a>
            . Without support systems and safety nets, a household can become
            homeless because of a health issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, uninsured physical health costs for those who are
            chronically homeless in Florida sap community resources. Because
            people who are homeless are less likely to access primary health
            care and address health concerns early, health issues are
            exacerbated. Uninsured emergency room visits and inpatient stays
            skyrocket.
          </p>
          <p>
            Third, like physical health costs, treatment for mental health
            issues and substance abuse among those who are homeless is often
            limited to crisis response and emergency services. Ultimately,
            people who are uninsured and homeless cycle in and out of crisis and
            health systems, resulting in high community costs but limited
            improvements in health.

          <p>
            Homelessness among single adults, like homelessness among other
            populations, is a result of the lack of affordable, available
            housing. Because of the cost of housing and inadequate incomes, even
            a temporary financial or life crisis, such as losing a job, the end
            of a relationship, death of a partner, or health emergency, can
            result in a loss of housing and homelessness.
          </p>
          <p>
            The experience of homelessness for this population is most often
            brief and non-recurring. Despite common stereotypes, most homeless
            single adults do not suffer from chronic mental illness, substance
            abuse, or other disabling conditions and most are homeless for a
            relatively short time before reconnecting to housing.

            Children who experience housing instability are more likely to have
            emotional and physical health issues, and are less likely to
            participate in and do well in school. Further, the experience of
            homelessness makes it more challenging for the head of household
            wage-earner to become or stay employed, precipitating a downward
            spiral making it even more difficult to recover housing and family
            stability.

            Persons who are identified as “chronically homeless” are those who
            have been homeless for longer than a year and have a disabling
            condition. People who have been homeless a long time and have
            disabling conditions tend to be the most frequent utilizers of
            community emergency services and costly community resources. Many
            are also among the most medically vulnerable of people who are
            homeless due to serious medical conditions.

            move out of homelessness and into permanent housing is one of the
            country and Florida’s top priorities. Despite the fact this group
            makes up less than 16 percent of those who are homeless in Florida,
            it is likely that when a typical taxpayer, business owner, or
            tourist thinks about the word “homeless,” chronically homeless
            individuals are most likely to come to mind.

            The objectives of an efficient{' '}
            <strong>crisis response system</strong> are to identify those
            experiencing homelessness, prevent homelessness when possible,
            connect people with housing quickly and provide services when
            needed.
          </p>
          <p>A well oiled system achieves these by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Outreach: </strong>This is a strategy that involves
              engaging with unsheltered homeless people in whatever location
              they naturally stay (e.g. in campsites, on the streets), building
              trust through assertive engagement, and offering access to
              appropriate housing interventions.{' '}
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Coordinated Entry: </strong>This is a standardized
              community-wide process to outreach, identify, and triage homeless
              households. This process consists of utilizing a common tool to
              assess the level and type of needs, enter the household
              information into the local Homeless Management Information System
              (HMIS), provide appropriate referrals, and prioritize access to
              housing interventions and services to end their homelessness.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Diversion &amp; Prevention: </strong>
              <em>Prevention</em> provides services and financial assistance to
              prevent someone from becoming homeless. <em>Diversion</em> is a
              strategy that prevents homelessness for people at the point when
              they are seeking shelter.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Emergency Shelters/Interim Housing: </strong>A facility
              operated to provide temporary shelter for homeless people.
              Effective emergency shelters do not have barriers to entry (such
              as a sobriety requirement) and should be focused on connecting
              people with housing options to help them return to affordable
              rental units.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Permanent Housing: </strong>Safe and affordable housing
              for people with disabling conditions, with legal tenancy housing
              rights and access to flexible support services.{' '}
              <em>Rapid Re-Housing</em> is designed to move a household into
              permanent housing (e.g. a rental unit) as quickly as possible,
              ideally within 30 days.

            one. With incomes typically much lower than is needed to comfortably
            pay average rental costs, millions of people are financially
            vulnerable to homelessness and housing instability. A reduction in
            work hours, a lost job, an illness or an unexpected expense can
            spiral into an inability to pay the rent, an eviction, reliance on
            extended family for a place to stay, and, sometimes, entry into a
            homeless shelter.
